This is the link to the little demonstration that I produced (AngularJS frontent,
Python backend). It will display a map that is geolocated (you must allow it to
do this by responding when it asks). If you click on the map the frontend will
send the <lat,lng> of the point that you clicked on to the backend which will
contact a geolocation and weather webservice, reformat the data and send it back
to the frontend to be redisplayed as a table below the map. The source is
available in the "GitHub" link on the page.

This application which is designed to run on Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk.
